                    The story I want to tell with this project will start by investigating if charities nowadays are more "active" 
                    or not and if social media have some power when we talk about charities.

                <p class = "p-font">
                    Once investigated these general questions the focus will be on what Italy has experienced starting from the beginning of February with COVID-19 
                    and how platforms like GoFoundMe has helped the ICs of the Italian hospital.

                    Why has public healthcare needed some type of charity during this pandemic? 
                    In the past year the government has cut the budget for public healthcare, has this got some effect on the current situation? 
                    The case of the GoFoundMe fundraiser created by the influencer Chiara Ferragni and Fedez.

                    Charity is not only about money, it is also about humanism: from Naples the story of the panaro and spesa sospesa for homeless people.

                    The main actor when we talk about public healthcare is the government. Inside of which we can find people who want to keep it public and who want to make it private.
