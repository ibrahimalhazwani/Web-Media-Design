                <h1 class="xlarge-font">GIFs and memems to understand the younger generation</h1>
                <h3>What the topic is about</h3>
                <p class="p-font">
                    Internet memes and GIFs are used to celebrate, mock or satirize current events. 
                    Nowadays these two forms of communication have become a defining part of how teenagers communicate in the digital world. 
                    Considering one big event (like Coronavirus or American Election) what can we understand about the younger generation? 
                    How did they use this tool? What insight about the society we have by analyzing it?
                </p>

                <h3>Who will be the audience?</h3>
                <p class = "p-font">
                    Social media companies, geeks, young people, consulting companies 
                </p>

                <h3>Existing similar project</h3>
                <p class = "p-font">
                    In my week's research I haven't found any data project around how memes are used
                    but a lot of very good articles. The only big project I found was about how memes spread around the web.
                </p>
                <p class="p-font">
                    Starting from how memes are born to a study around the memes about the topic of world war III that has been around
                    in the first days of 2020.
                </p>

                <h3>What could be the story about</h3>
                <p class="p-font">
                    I still have to figure out (sorry). 
                </p>

                <h3>Main position in the debate</h3>
                <p class="p-font">
                    Around the topic of the memes, there are two positions: the one that thinks memes are leading to misinformation and
                    underestimating real problem like could be coronavirus; on the other side there are people that think that memes are used
                    to stimulate younger people by laughing to investigate some real issues.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Bonus point</h3>
                <p class="p-font">
                    Why this so basic and minimal website? For the following reasons.
                </p>
                <p class="p-font">
                    The first reason is that I am a more "technical person" and doing this part of brainstorming (alone) was not so easy
                    but, I am happy to participate in this course because is helping me to see problems in a different way and to
                    developing critical thinking around topics and not just reading the data.
                </p>
                <p class="p-font">
                    The second reason is that I love simple but effective website. Also, I want to keep my mind as black as possible for when I will
                    start thinking about how to structure the final website.
                </p>
                <p class="p-font">
                    The last reason is that in the last days I was thinking of completing change topic and move to the topic of the "panaro", the
                    the typical basket of vimini. This idea came in mind after I saw of video from Naples where an old woman has used it for giving some food 
                    to a homeless that was searching some around the street of the city. Arond this idea I have also imagined how the website will look like
                    but by doing some research around the topic, I haven't found much and since the project, as I would like to make, should be data-oriented I have
                    abandoned the idea, that maybe I will use for a personal project.
