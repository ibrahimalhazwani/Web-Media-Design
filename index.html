                    Coronavirus is forcing us to change the way we were used to living, it is a big deal. In Italy, we are in quarantine for almost four weeks.

                    So let's explore the enormous world of memes and GIFs. How are they used? 
                    Are memes politically correct? Just a lighter topic in a moment where we are surrounded by bad news.
